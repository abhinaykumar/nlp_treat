I tried to replicate the issue today when trying to send 125 and 250 SMS Messages on two different occasions. Both worked fine. I then tried sending 250 SMS Messages and 250 emails and also worked fine.

I am using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk for my PHP pages and RDS for my MySQL database.

Does this sound like a PHP or MySQL issue? And if neither are giving me anything in the error logs, do you have any suggestions as to what I can do to further debug this? Are there some other hidden logs or logging I should turn on?

Or is there any MySQL or PHP settings I should look at to try get around the issue?
