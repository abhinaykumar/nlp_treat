You'll have to excuse my lack of details in regards to this question as I am still trying to work out what's going on.

I understand there may not be a straight answer to this but any help I can get will help me further debug the issue.

My issue is that all of a sudden my PHP script will exit and display a white page. No PHP or MySQL errors on the page and none in the error logs.

The issue occurs at very random times. When it does occur, it "appears" to be when there are a large number of MySQL queries are run at one time. When I say large, it might be a few hundred when sending out emails. Sometimes thousands, if a large import is occurring.

The last time this issue happened was last night when a user tried to send out 118 SMS Messages. After each SMS was queue and also stored in the archive, there would have been roughly a couple hundred queries.
